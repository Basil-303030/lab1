        <h1>Getting to know Bayleigh</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> My name is Bayleigh Clock and I am a Sophomore in the Graphic Design program. I have a service dog that helps me with everyday tasks and makes me laugh with how goofy he is. I am 20 years old and I am from New Hampshire. I enjoy playing games with my friend Connor (whom I call Ronnoc behind his back sometimes haha). I love taking the train around the city but I despise taking the red line and avoid it at all costs.</p>
